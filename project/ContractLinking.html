Legal people could search for certain keywords in the application, and review details of contracts from the search results. I was responsible for identifying the user flow and creating user interface mock-up for future implementation. I was based in Thomson Reuters Labs in Boston, this project was a collaboration with the data scientist team from the Lab in Waterloo, Canada. Corey Ouellette, the Data Experience Developer also based in Waterloo was my primary advisor for this project.</p></div>

The data scientist team needed a visual technique to show the results. “Data visualization” was the first visual technique that we targeted, and the original goal was to show the relationship between entities, clauses and contracts. The results could be displayed as a network chart, a data table or a sunburst diagram. However, the purpose is for legal people to explore and review the contracts, these visualizations seem taking too much space on the screen. Moreover, users could spend more time than expected on interacting with visualizations instead of contracts themselves. Therefore, I decided to think about “how would user use this tool” first, and see if data visualization could help during the process.</p></div>

                  <div class = 'sub-para'><p>How to display search results is the major challenge of this project. The search results are the contracts that include keywords. The results will also serve as “menu”, helping users navigate to a section, a clause or a sentence in a contract they need. Therefore, we need a visual message to tell users “Hey, this contract/section has the keywords you just search!”, and use frequency or other measurements to show how relevant that this contract or this section is to the keywords. To achieve the goal, I have tried some ideas.</p></div>

                  <div class = 'sub-para'><p>This approach uses circles to locate where keywords are in contracts, one circle is one time the keywords show up. This approach could help users get a sense of how the keywords distribute across multiple contracts. After they see the results with multiple contracts, users could select one and go into next page for a single contract. However, if users are in the single-contract view, and they would like to see other contracts, they would have to go to last page and select another. It would be better to prevent this back and forth process.</p></div>

                  <div class = 'sub-para'><p>This approach shows the relationship between keywords and sections in contracts directly. The scale of circles indicates how relevant the sections are to the searched keywords; the bigger the circle, higher the relevance. When mouse over an orange bar, the box with contract sections will be opened. If a section has no keywords mentioned, then that section will be in lighter color so that users would only focus on related sections. However, the first problem with this approach is “the scale of circles”. Since the space of showing the relevance circles is limited. Within a narrow space, the difference between circles would be invisible. Moreover, if we try to make the difference more apparent, circles that represent “only a little bit relevance” could be really small, which is not helpful. Another problem with this idea is also the redundant interaction. Similar to the last idea, users would need to go back and forth between contract menu page and contract content page.</p></div>

                  <div class = 'sub-para'><p>In order to solve the problem about “scaling” and “redundant interaction.” I decided to 1) standardize the size of the symbol of relevance, using color to indicate different level of relevance like a heat map. 2) display the contract menu and contract content side by side, instead of having them in different pages. With this approach, users could get a overall sense of how relevant the contracts are to the keywords they search; the darker the orange, the higher the relevance. If they are interested in a contract, they could click and open the contract tab, go into a section, and the content will be displayed on the right.</p></div>

User will always see menu and contract content together, and go to other contracts/sections without switching to other pages. This "side by side” design was actually highly valued in the user interview, because it’s intuitive to explore and view the contracts from users’ opinions.</p></div>
