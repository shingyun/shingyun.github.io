I was working with internal analysis team and an external data analyst under Brian Romer’s supervision at Thomson Reuters Labs. For me, it was a journey of balancing opposites perspectives. Analysts acted as audience for my visualization in this project. We integrated opinions from analysts and designers, and reach a consensus on the final visual solution.</p></div>

Some work was needed to transform raw data into the workable format. Luckily I got some Python experts around, it is a nice chance to learn Python from them and benefit my project. I used Python to transform data into the format I need, and moved on to several visual experiments.</p></div>

A good news was that it is not a big dataset, therefore static format should not be a problem. </p></div>

The chord chart from R was a potential solution aside from network chart, but this idea was rejected immediately from the analysis side. The existing and common (particularly for designers) solutions did not work out. I turned to the most fundamental approach — hand sketch.</p></div>

                  <div class = 'sub-para'><p>After trying several approaches that are common in visualization practice and finding nothing really works, I picked up a pencil and did some random sketches. In a discussion with Brian, he mentioned that we should be able to track every node, and some nodes might have potential relationship. For example, Bank A and Bank B both link directly to Politician C, this might imply that Bank A and Bank B have a connection potentially. Thinking further toward this direction, an image of “a string of cherries” came into my mind. Each cherry is separate but connected to the same point.</p></div>
